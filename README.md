This Gradescope Autograder source was written with ease of extension in mind.

The mock_gradescope_docker_dir allows the programmer to easily visualize where relative paths will lead once the autograder has been uploaded.

Running the make_autograder_zip.sh script copies the source code from the mock directory and arranges it as necessary for use on Gradescope, then zips it.
